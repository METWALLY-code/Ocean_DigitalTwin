# Ocean DigitalTwin project

This project aims to familiarize with existing packages for Geospatial and trying to build a simple Ocean Digital Twin

- Erddapy : ERDDAP is a data server that provides a consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets. (https://ioos.github.io/erddapy/)
- Argopy : Argo is a real-time global ocean in situ observing system. (https://argopy.readthedocs.io/)
- Cartopy : Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. (https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/)
- Xarray : Xarray makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays in Python simple and efficient. (https://docs.xarray.dev/)
- netCDF4: Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. (https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)
- Scipy: A Python package for scientific computing (https://scipy.org/)
-
- toolz : Toolz provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries. These functions interoperate well and form the building blocks of common data analytic operations.
- 
- requests : Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. It is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python. (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- aiohttp : Asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for asyncio and Python. (https://docs.aiohttp.org/)
- fsspec: Filesystem interfaces for Python ()

- Utilities
    - gsw : Gibbs Seawater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox. It is Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based primarily on numpy ufunc wrappers of the GSW-C implementation.
    - tqdm :
    - zarr : Zarr is a file storage format for chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays based on an open-source specification.

- Performances
    - dask : Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel computing. Dask scales Python code from multi-core local machines to large distributed clusters in the cloud. (https://www.dask.org/)
    - distributed : A library for distributed computation ()
    - pyarrow : Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to store, process and move data fast. The Arrow Python bindings (also named “PyArrow”) have
                first-class integration with NumPy, pandas, and built-in Python objects. They are based on the C++ implementation of Arrow.

- Visualisation
    - IPython : IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most of using Python interactively
    - Cartopy : Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ, NumPy and Shapely libraries and includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps.
    - Ipykernel : The IPython kernel is the Python execution backend for Jupyter (https://ipython.readthedocs.io/)
    - Ipywidgets : Jupyter Widgets are interactive browser controls for Jupyter notebooks. (https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/)
    - Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.  (https://matplotlib.org/)
    - Seaborn : Seaborn is a high level interface for drawing statistical graphics with Matplotlib.
